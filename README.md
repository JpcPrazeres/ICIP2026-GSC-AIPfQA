## Folder and File Descriptions

### 📁 `camera_paths/`
Contains camera trajectory definitions used to render or display the video content evaluated in the subjective experiments. These paths ensure consistent viewpoints and motion across reference and coded sequences.

### 📁 `videos_ref/reference/`
Folder containing the reference video sequences presented to subjects.

### 📁 `videos_coded/coded/`
Folder containing the coded video sequences.

### 📄 `Results.xlsx`
Contains the collected subjective evaluation results, such as Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), confidence intervals, or other derived statistics used for analysis.

### 📄 `Subject_List.xlsx`
Information related to test participants, including anonymized subject identifiers and any grouping or screening information used in the study.
